from memory import AIMemory
"""
Module: test.py
Description:
    This module demonstrates the usage of the AIMemory class to manage conversation
    memory in both asynchronous and synchronous manners. Messages from a user and responses
    from an AI are sent to a backend server, and the responses are retrieved and stored in JSON
    files.

Usage:
    1. Asynchronous Usage:
        - Iterates over a list of messages and sends them to the server using asynchronous
          HTTP POST requests via the 'apost' method.
        - Retrieves memory based on a query via the 'aget' method and saves the result in
          'response_asynchronous.json'.
        - Closes the AI Memory connection after operations are completed.

    2. Synchronous Usage:
        - Iterates over the same list of messages and sends them using synchronous HTTP POST
          requests via the 'post' method.
        - Retrieves memory using the 'get' method and saves the result in 'response_synchronous.json'.
        - Note: This synchronous section requires an appropriate event loop context, as it uses 'await'.

Global Variables:
    - ai_memory: Singleton instance of AIMemory configured with the base URL.
    - USER_ID: A unique string to represent the user (email address).
    - CONVERSATION_ID: Identifier for the conversation session.
    - messages: List of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains:
        - type: The message type (e.g., "human" or "ai").
        - text: The content of the message.

Notes:
    - The module assumes that the backend server is available at the specified base URL (http://0.0.0.0:8182).
    - The detailed travel recommendation text demonstrates handling multi-line strings and JSON payloads.
    - The code is structured to showcase both asynchronous and synchronous paradigms for educational purposes.
